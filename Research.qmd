Building on recent advances from the SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) mission and associated FaSt-SWOT field campaigns, we observed a small-scale intrathermocline anticyclonic eddy in the Western Mediterranean Sea during April–May 2023. SWOT and multi-platform in-situ observations revealed that this eddy had a ~25 km radius, extended from 50 to 400 m depth, and produced ~3 cm sea surface height (SSH) anomalies. However, subsurface measurements remain scarce, and the full 3D structure and temporal evolution of the intrathermocline eddy are poorly understood. In this study, we assimilated both SWOT (L3 LR SSH product) and in-situ observations from the FaSt-SWOT campaign into the Western Mediterranean OPerational forecasting system (WMOP) regional ocean model at 2 km and hourly resolution, matching the SWOT grid to ensure smooth data assimilation while resolving fast-evolving finescale processes. We tested three assimilation strategies on top of generic assimilation of along-track SSH, SST, and Argo profiles: (1) SWOT SSH only, (2) Glider and CTD in-situ observations only, and (3) both combined. The model was run with assimilation for a week, then validated using independent observations in the following week. Our results indicate that SWOT-only assimilation successfully captured the horizontal structure but hardly resolved the subsurface fields, whereas vertical in-situ-only assimilation did not allow us to properly represent the sea surface variability. In contrast, the combined assimilation was able to realistically reconstruct the 3D eddy structure and associated sea level signal. This highlights the feasibility and value of integrating spatially extensive satellite data with vertically resolved in-situ measurements into a regional ocean model. Validation shows good agreement in both density fields and their gradients between the joint assimilation results and observations, underscoring that high-resolution, data-assimilative modelling offers a powerful tool to reconstruct finescale subsurface ocean processes. Beyond the technical work, these novel high-resolution 4D datasets provide a unique opportunity to investigate the full life cycle of the eddy, from its generation through intensification to decay.

While the effect of wind stress aligned with frontal jets has been extensively studied, focusing on an adequate understanding of the role of \emph{cross}-front winds is largely lacking at the moment. This study investigates the effects of cross-front winds on a submesoscale dense filament in the central Baltic Sea using high-resolution turbulence and velocity observations, supplemented by idealized numerical simulations. Our focus is a 3–4 km wide submesoscale dense filament, characterized by cross-front winds and asymmetric frontal structures in both hydrography and turbulence. Cross-front winds are categorized as upgradient winds (directed from lighter to denser waters) and down-gradient winds (in the opposite direction). Upgradient winds drive near-surface currents that reinforce the frontal secondary circulation, enhancing restratification and leading to a shoaling mixed-layer depth. Meanwhile, their associated subsurface Ekman transport strengthens the frontal jet, generating turbulence through marginal shear instability. Conversely, down-gradient winds induce destructive effects by generating near-surface currents that oppose the secondary circulation, while their subsurface Ekman transport counteracts the frontal jet, ultimately disrupting frontal dynamics. This study highlights the the crucial role of cross-front wind forcing in regulating air-sea momentum and buoyancy exchange, modulating vertical mixing and upper-ocean stratification.

Previous studies have highlighted the individual importance of diurnal warm layers (DWLs) and surface-layer fronts within the surface boundary layer (SBL) in regulating energy, momentum, and gas exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean. This study investigates the interactions between DWLs and surface-layer fronts using field observations and numerical turbulence models. Our study provides the real-ocean relevance of the coexistence of DWLs and surface-layer fronts in the SBL in an eddy-rich tropical ocean subjected to intense solar heating and weak winds. We found that the presence of a DWL isolates the deeper layers of the SBL from diabatic and frictional surface forcing, causing these layers to quickly become non-turbulent whereas remaining in a state of marginal stability. This condition suggests that small perturbations from local processes, such as internal tides and waves, can easily trigger instability and turbulence. Additionally, frontal dynamics were observed to deepen the SBL, allowing near-surface diurnal shear associated with DWL dynamics to penetrate to greater depths during nighttime, compared to conditions without a front, thereby facilitating the vertical transport of heat and tracers. Our findings underscore the necessity of accurately representing the interactions between DWLs and surface-layer fronts to enhance the precision of ocean circulation and climate models.

Recent high-resolution numerical simulations have shown that the diurnal variability in the atmospheric forcing strongly affects the dynamics, stability, and turbulence of submesoscale structures in the surface boundary layer (SBL). Field observations supporting the real-ocean relevance of these studies are, however, largely lacking at the moment. Here, the impact of large diurnal variations in the surface heat flux on a dense submesoscale upwelling filament in the Benguela upwelling system is investigated, based on a combination of densely spaced turbulence microstructure observations and surface drifter data. Our data show that during nighttime and early morning conditions, when solar radiation is still weak, frontal turbulence is generated by a mix of symmetric and shear instability. In this situation, turbulent diapycnal mixing is approximately balanced by frontal restratification associated with the cross-front secondary circulation. During daytime, when solar radiation is close to its peak value, the SBL quickly restratifies, the conditions for frontal instability are no longer fulfilled, and SBL turbulence collapses except for a thin wind-driven layer near the surface. The drifter data suggest that inertial oscillations periodically modulate the stability characteristics and energetics of the submesoscale fronts bounding the filament.

Based on high-resolution turbulence microstructure and near-surface velocity data, frontal instability and its relation to turbulence are investigated inside a transient upwelling filament in the Benguela upwelling system (southeast Atlantic). The focus of our study is a sharp submesoscale front located at the edge of the filament, characterized by persistent downfront winds, a strong frontal jet, and vigorous turbulence. Our analysis reveals three distinct frontal stability regimes. (i) On the light side of the front, a 30–40-m-deep turbulent surface layer with low potential vorticity (PV) was identified. This low-PV region exhibited a well-defined two-layer structure with a convective (Ekman-forced) upper layer and a stably stratified lower layer, where turbulence was driven by forced symmetric instability (FSI). Dissipation rates in this region scaled with the Ekman buoyancy flux, in excellent quantitative agreement with recent numerical simulations of FSI. (ii) Inside the cyclonic flank of the frontal jet, near the maximum of the cross-front density gradient, the cyclonic vorticity was sufficiently strong to suppress FSI. Turbulence in this region was driven by marginal shear instability. (iii) Inside the anticyclonic flank of the frontal jet, conditions for mixed inertial/symmetric instability were satisfied. Our data provide direct evidence for the relevance of FSI, inertial instability, and marginal shear instability for overall kinetic energy dissipation in submesoscale fronts and filaments.

Sea surface temperature (SST) variability affects marine ecosystems, fisheries, ocean primary productivity and human activities and is the primary influence on typhoon intensity. SST drops of a few degrees in the open ocean after typhoon passages have been widely documented; however, few studies have focused on coastal SST variability. The purpose of this study is to determine typhoon-induced SST drops in the near-coastal area (within 1 km of the coast) and understand the possible mechanism. The results of this study were based on extensive field data analysis. Significant SST drop phenomena were observed at the Longdong Buoy in northeastern Taiwan during 43 typhoons over the past 20 years (1998–2017). The mean SST drop (ΔSST) after a typhoon passage was 6.1 ∘C, and the maximum drop was 12.5 ∘C (Typhoon Fungwong in 2008). The magnitude of the SST drop was larger than most of the observations in the open ocean. The mean duration of the SST drop was 24 h, and on average, 26.1 h were required for the SST to recover to the original temperature. The coastal SST drops at Longdong were correlated with the moving tracks of typhoons. When a typhoon passes south of Longdong, the strong and persistent longshore winds induce coastal upwelling and pump cold water up to the surface, which is the dominant cause of the SST drops along the coast. In this study, it was determined that cold water mainly intruded from the Kuroshio subsurface into the Okinawa Trough, which is approximately 50 km from the observation site. The magnitude of coastal SST drops depends on the area of overlap between typhoons generating strong winds and the Kuroshio.

The potential for coastal freak waves (CFWs) represents a threat to people living in coastal areas. CFWs are generated via the evolution of a wave and its interactions with coastal structures or rocks; however, the exact mechanism of their formation is not clear. Here, a data-driven warning model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to predict the possibility of CFW occurrence. Seven parameters (significant wave height, peak period, wind speed, wave groupiness factor, Benjamin Feir Index (BFI), kurtosis, and wind-wave direction misalignment) collected prior to the occurrence of the CFW are used to develop the model. The buoy data associated with 40 known CFW events are used for model training, and the data associated with 23 such events are used for validation. The use of data obtained during the 6-h period prior to CFW occurrence combined with the same amount of non-CFW data is shown to produce the best model. Two validations using media-published and camera-recorded CFW events show that the accuracy rate (ACR) exceeds 90% and the recall rate (RCR) exceeds 87%, demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed model. This warning model has been implemented in operational runs since 2016.
